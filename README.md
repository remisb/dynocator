- Uses [Froala](https://editor.froala.com) editor to write/edit posts
- Has an admin section to add/remove/edit posts
- Support for drafts
- Categories
- Watches `posts` folder for changes so that new posts are automagically converted to static html files
- Can either create a blog index page from posts, or use one of the posts as the main index page
- Uses Go's cool templates to make simple but powerful frontend
